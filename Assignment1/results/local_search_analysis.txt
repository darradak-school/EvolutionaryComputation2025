Looking at the data in local_search.txt, we can see that the exchange method consistently performs worse than both two-opt,
and jump, regularly getting higher minima and means on all datasets. 

Two-opt and jump appear relatively equivalent in terms of performance on smaller datasets. 
However, as the datasets increase in size two-opt performs consistently better, 
with jump having a 50% larger minimum result compared to two-opt on the usa13509 dataset and almost double 
the minimum of two-opt on the pr2392 dataset. 

Overall, two-opt has the best results on average, and consistently finds the lower minima, especially on larger datasets, 
and is faster in almost every case, with the exception of usa13509.
