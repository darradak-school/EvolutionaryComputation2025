When comparing our EA with the inverover algorithm across small to medium TSPs, inverover consistently achieves shorter tours in comparable times, 
often within 5% of the optimum. On larger sets like pcb442 inverover is still achieving lower results, but is slower, 
on very large problems (pr2392, usa13509), the EA produces much lower tours and runs faster (~2Ã—), indicating better scalability. 
Both curves were still improving at the generation limit, so more time would likely compress gaps, but the crossover point clearly favours the EA at scale. 
Overall, inverover for quality early; EA for big instances/time-to-solution.
