ALGORITHM DESIGNS

STEADY STATE ALGORITHM (MURAD):
This algorithm uses tournament selection for parent selection to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation, 
order crossover because it is faster and simpler than other methods and maintains genetic diversity while passing on good segments, 
and swap mutation for similar reasons. 
Its low replacement rate (5%) is to make the algorithm faster, as we must replace less individuals, and to preserve genetic diversity. 
This algorithm produces results within 10-40% of the optimum but depends on landing in a good local environment, 
as it gets stuck in local optima easily due to low replacement rate. 
However, it produces results fast, only 3 seconds for 200 individuals and 20,000 generations on eil51.
